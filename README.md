# audio-text-extraction-from-mp4
Tool for extracting the transcription of a mp4.
With the help of libraries such as pocketspinx, moviepy and speech rocognition
this is a python based tool programmed on a jupyter notbook.

For testing, initially an mp4 of Drishti IAS's lecture over mahatma gandhi is taken, 
downloaded from youtube.
further more firstly it's audio.mp3 was created, 
then audio's daw and lastly the text transcriptions of the daw stockpiled in txt format.

Over here the input is vid.mp4 and the output here is the recognised vid_transcription.txt
The accuracy of this program is scanty, however the output was generated in 600 seconds.
